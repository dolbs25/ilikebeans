<li> In "The Music Man," con man Harold Hill pretends to be a music instructor and sells band instruments and uniforms to the people of River City, Iowa, promising to organize a boys' band, but he doesn't know music. His plans to leave town are foiled when he falls for the town librarian, Marian, and he unexpectedly finds himself genuinely caring for the town and its people. </li>


<p>lyrics:</p>
<p>There were bells on the hill, 
	<br>
but I never heard them ringing.
<br>
No, I never heard them at all,
<br>
'til there was you.
<br>
<br>
There were birds in the sky,
<br>
but I never saw them winging.
<br>
No, I never saw them at all,
<br>
'til there was you.
<br>
<br>
And there was music,
<br>
and there were wonderful roses, they tell me,
<br>
in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and dew.
<br>
<br>
There was love, all around,
<br>
but I never heard it singing.
<br>
No, I never heard it at all,
<br>
'til there was you.
<br>
<br>
There was love, all around,
<br>
but I never heard it singing.
<br><br>
No, I never heard it at all,
<br>
'til there was you.
</p>
