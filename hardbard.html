<p>lyrics:</p>
<p>SHAKESPEARE:My days are so busy
	<br>
It's making me dizzy, there's so much I gotta do
<br>
There's lunches and meetings
<br>
And poetry readings and endless interviews
<br>
<br>
Gotta pose for a portrait
<br>
And how I deplore sitting there for eternity
<br>
Then it's off to the inn
<br>
Where my innkeeper friend wants to name a drink after me
<br>
<br>
Then it's back to my room
<br>
Where I resume my attempt to write a hit
<br>
Just me and my beer
<br>
And the terrible fear that I might be losing it
<br>
<br>
And it's hard (it's hard)
<br>
It's hard (it's hard)
<br>
It's really, really hard (it's really hard)
<br>
So very, very hard
<br>
<br>
I make it look easy but, honey, believe me
<br>
It's hard (it's hard)
<br>
It's hard (it's hard)
<br>
It's so incredibly hard
<br>
So inconceivably, unbelievably hard
<br>
<br>
It's hard to be the bard
<br>
Honestly, I don't know how I do it
<br>
There's only so much of me to go around
<br>
<br>
I've got so many fans with so many demands
<br>
I can hardly go take a piss (he can't pee)
<br>
Be it theater freak or the autograph-seeker
<br>
They all want a piece of this (gimme, gimme)
<br>
<br>
It's a cross that I bear, I'm like Jesus
<br>
I swear it's a burden, but I suffer through it (he is suffering)
<br>
It's all part of the game, the trappings of fame
<br>
But somebody's gotta do it (so he does it)
<br>
<br>
And I know, I know, I gotta go
<br>
And get back to my pen and ink
<br>
Oh, don't make me do it
<br>
Don't make me go through it
<br>
Can somebody get me a drink?
<br>
<br>
'Cause it's hard (it's hard)
<br>
It's hard (it's hard)
<br>
It's really, really hard (it's really hard)
<br>
It's sexy, but it's hard
<br>
<br>
This bar that I'm raising to be this amazing!
<br>
It's hard (it's hard)
<br>
It's hard (it's hard)
<br>
It's so annoyingly hard
<br>
So unavoidably, unenjoyably hard
<br>
<br>
It's hard to be the bard, baby, ugh
<br>
I know writing made me famous
<br>
But being famous is just so much more fun
<br>
<br>
You see, what people just don't understand
<br>
Is that writing's demanding
<br>
It's mentally challenging and it's a bore
<br>
It's such a chore to sit in a room by yourself
<br>
Oh my God, I just hate it!
<br>
<br>
And you're trying to find an opening line
Or a brilliant idea and you're pacing the floor
<br>
And hoping for, just a bit of divine intervention
<br>
That one little nugget, that one little spark
<br>
Then, Eureka, you find it you're ready to start
<br>
So now you can write, right? 
<br>
Wrong!
<br>
You're not even close, you remember that, damn it
<br>
Your play's gotta be in iambic pentameter!
<br>
<br>
So you write down a word, but it's not the right word
<br>
So you try a new word, but you hate the new word
<br>
And you need a good word, but you can't find the word
<br>
Oh, where is it? What is it? What is it? Where is it?
<br>
<br>
ASSISTANT:Sir?
<br>
SHAKESPEATRE:Hello!
<br>
ASSISTANT:You asked for information on what Nicholas Bottom is writing
<br>
Our spy is here with the news
<br>
SHAKESPEARE:Did he see me losing it?
<br>
ASSISTANT:He's half blind, sir
<br>
SHAKESPEARE:Oh, good, then he only saw half of it
<br>
You see what I did?
<br>
ASSISTANT:Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, wonderful!
<br>
<br>
SHAKESPEARE:Speak, man, what news?
<br>
SPY:I saw Nick Bottom, I did
<br>
He paid a soothsayer to foresee what 
<br>
Shakespeare's greatest play would be
<br>
SHAKESPEARE:That sneaky little thief!
<br>
Why doesn't he come up with his own ideas?
<br>
<br>
no, it is, isn't it?
<br>
It's really the worst (it's hard)
<br>
Makes me wonder why I didn't think of that first (it's hard)
<br>
Hard to alleviate the pressure to create (it's hard)<br>
Hard to do something as good as the last thing I did that was already great
<br>
<br>
it's hard
<br>
So hard that he is stealing from the bard
<br>
Well, I'll hoist him by his petard (ooh)
<br>
All that I need is a clever disguise (clever disguise)
<br>
I'll make him pay for his devious lies (devious lies)
<br>
Let him do all the tedious stuff
<br>
The work that's terribly and unbearably hard (ooh, hard)
<br>
<br>
Alright, Nick Bottom
<br>
I think Shakespeare needs to find out
What Shakespeare's next big hit will be
<br>
<br>
'Cause it's hard (it's hard, it's totally hard)
<br>
It's hard (it's hard, it's totally hard)
<br>
It's hard (it's hard, it's totally hard)
<br>
I've got fortune and fame
<br>
Everyone knows my name
<br>
I can't help it, it's still freakin' hard
<br>
