<p>lyrics:</p>
<p>SALLY: Oh yeah? That's what you think! 
	<br>
SCHROEDER:What?
<br>
SALLY:That's my new philosophy
<br>
Oh yeah? That's what you think!
<br>
SCHROEDER:Well, why are you telling me?
<br>
SALLY:What?
<br>
SCHROEDER:why are you telling me?
<br>
SALLY:Why are you telling me?
<br>
I like it!
<br>
<br>
SALLY:That's a good philosophy
<br>
Why are you telling me?
<br>
Why are you telling me?
<br>
Why are you telling me?
<br>
My new philosophy
<br>
The teacher gave a D on last week's homework
<br>
She said "Miss Sally Brown, your grades are going down"
<br>
I could have told her
<br>
SCHROEDER: Your new philosophy? SALLY:(My new philosophy)
<br>
<br>
SALLY:Miss B?
<br>
I'm she
<br>
Look see, a "D?"
<br>
A "D"
<br>
Well, why are you telling me?
<br>
And that's my new philosophy!
<br>
SCHROEDER:That's your new philosophy
<br>
SALLY:Why are you telling me?
<br>
My new philosophy
<br>
<br>
SCHROEDER:That's great, Sally, but I've gotta go practice Chopin's Nocturne in B-Flat minor
<br>
SALLY:No!
<br>
I like it!
<br>
No!
<br>
That's a good philosophy
<br>
No!
No!
No!
<br>
SCHROEDER:That's your new philosophy, huh?
<br>
SALLY:Yes!
<br>
I mean no!
<br>
<br>
Just like a busy bee
<br>
Each new philosophy
<br>
Can fly from tree to tree and keep me moving
<br>
When life's a dizzy maze
<br>
On alternating days
<br>
I choose a different phrase
<br>
<br>
SCHROEDER:Your new philosophy?
<br>
SALLY:My new philosophy!
<br>
<br>
SCHROEDER:Sally!
<br>
Some philosophies are simple
<br>
"Man does not live by bread alone"
<br>
Some philosophies are clear
<br>
SALLY:"Leave your message at the sound of the tone"
<br>
BOTH:Some philosophies pick and choose
<br>
Deciding what goes in and
<br>
SCHROEDER:Some take a lifetime
<br>
SALLY:Mine take a minute
<br>
<br>
SCHROEDER:But, Sally, anything that takes only a minute can't be very lasting
<br>
For instance, Beethoven took over two years to complete his brilliant Ninth Symphony
<br>
<br>
SALLY:No!
<br>
SCROEDER:I can't stand it!
<br>
SALLY:I can't stand it!
<br>
I like it!
<br>
It's like a guarantee
<br>
My new philosophy
<br>
And things are sure to be a whole lot brighter
<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah? That's what you think!
<br>
Why are you telling me?
<br>
No!
<br>
I can't stand it!
<br>
Now life is free and easy
<br>
Much more philosophy-zy
<br>
With my brand new
<br>
<br>
You know, someone has said that we should live each day as if it were the last day of our life
<br>
RANDO:Ah! This is the last day! This is it!
I only have twenty-four hours left!
<br>
Help me! Help me!
<br>
This is the last day! Ah!
<br>
SALLY:Clearly, some philosophies aren't for all people
<br>
And that's my new philosophy!
